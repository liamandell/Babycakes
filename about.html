            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                At Babycakes Bakery, we're more than just a bake shop — we're a community staple, a family-run business,
                and a place where every treat is made with heart.
            </p>
            <p>
                Founded in 2010 in the heart of Austin, Babycakes started as a weekend pop-up by two sisters who shared
                a passion for pastries and people. Over the years, we’ve grown into a cozy brick-and-mortar shop serving
                hand-crafted desserts, locally sourced ingredients, and the same love we started with.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether you're grabbing your morning croissant, ordering a cake for your big day, or just stopping by
                for a warm cookie and a chat — we’re happy to have you.
            </p>
